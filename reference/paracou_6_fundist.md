# Functional distances between Paracou plot 6 species

A functional distance matrix of species of the dataset
[paracou_6_abd](https://ericmarcon.github.io/divent/reference/paracou_6.md).
Distances were computed from a trait dataset including specific leaf
area, wood density, seed mass and 95th percentile of height. Gower's
metric (Gower 1971) was used to obtain a distance matrix.

## Usage

``` r
paracou_6_fundist
```

## Format

A matrix.

## Source

Permanent data census of Paracou: <https://paracou.cirad.fr/>

## Details

This dataset is from Paracou field station, French Guiana, managed by
[Cirad](https://www.cirad.fr).
