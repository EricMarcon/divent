**divent** is an R package that provides functions to estimate alpha, beta and gamma diversity of communities, including phylogenetic and functional diversity.

It is a reboot of the package **entropart** to make it tidy, easier to use and optimize the code that has been added along years of research.

## Installation

You can install the development version of divent from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("EricMarcon/divent")
```

## Details

In the divent package, individuals of different *species* are counted in several *communities* which may (or not) be aggregated to define a *metacommunity*. 
In the metacommunity, the probability to find a species in the weighted average of probabilities in communities. 
This is a naming convention, which may correspond to plots in a forest inventory or any data organized the same way.

```{r MetaCommunitydf}
# Abundances of three communities with four species
abd <- matrix(
  c(
    10,  0, 25, 10, 
    20, 15, 10, 35, 
     0, 10,  5,  2
  ),
  ncol = 4
)
# Community weights
w <- c(1, 2, 1)

# Organize the data
library("divent")
abd |>
  as_abundances(weights = w) |>
  # Plot it
  plot(type = "Metacommunity")
```

Basic functions allow computing diversity of a community.
Example data is a 6.25ha plot of rainforest in Paracou, French Guiana, divided into 4 subplots.

```{r}
paracou_6_abd |>
  autoplot()
```


Entropies such as Shannon's, Simpson's, or Hurlbert's, and explicit diversity (i.e. effective number of species), aka Hill numbers, are estimated.

```{r estimation}
# Diversity of a tropical rainforest
div_richness(paracou_6_abd)
ent_shannon(paracou_6_abd)
ent_simpson(paracou_6_abd)
```

By default, the best available estimator of diversity is used, according to the data.
Diversity profiles are estimated.

```{r div_profile}
profile_hill(paracou_6_abd) %>% autoplot
```
  
Communities can be simulated and plotted.

```{r rcommunity}
rc <- rcommunity(1, size = 10000, distribution = "lnorm")
autoplot(rc, fit_rac = TRUE, distribution = "lnorm")
```
  
Phylogenetic entropy and diversity can be calculated if a phylogenetic (or functional), ultrametric tree is provided, with the state-of-the-art estimation-bias correction. 

```{r PhyloDiversity}
# Phylogenetic diversity of order 1, based on the taxonomy
div_phylo(paracou_6_abd, tree = paracou_6_taxo, q = 1)
```

Similarity-based diversity is calculated, based on a similarity matrix.

```{r SBDiversity}
# Similarity is computed from the functional distance matrix of Paracou species
Z <- fun_similarity(paracou_6_fundist)
# Calculate diversity of order 2
div_similarity(paracou_6_abd, similarities = Z, q = 2)
```


The diversity of a metacommunity, i.e. $\gamma$ diversity, can be partitioned into $\alpha$ (that of communities) and $\beta$ diversities.

```{r DivPart}
# Partitioning of diversity of order 1 (Shannon)
div_part(paracou_6_abd, q = 1)
```

## Vignettes

A quick [introduction](https://ericmarcon.github.io/divent/articles/divent.html) is in `vignette("divent")`.

A full documentation is available online, in the "Articles" section of the web site of the vignette.

The [documentation of the development version](https://EricMarcon.github.io/divent/dev/) is also available.
