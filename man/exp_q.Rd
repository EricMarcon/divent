\title{Deformed exponential}
\usage{
exp_q(x, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or array.}

\item{q}{A number.}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as \code{x} containing the transformed values.
}
\description{
Calculate the deformed exponential of order \emph{q}.
}
\details{
The deformed exponential is the reciprocal of the deformed logarithm
\insertCite{Tsallis1994}{divent}, see \link{lnq}.
It is defined as \eqn{(x(1-q)+1)^{\frac{1}{(1-q)}}}.
For \eqn{q>1}, \eqn{\ln_q{(+\infty)}=\frac{1}{(q-1)}}
so \eqn{\exp_q{(x)}} is not defined for \eqn{x>\frac{1}{(q-1)}}.
