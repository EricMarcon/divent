\arguments{
\item{x}{An object, that may be a numeric vector containing abundances or probabilities,
or an object of class \link{abundances}  or \link{probabilities}.}

\item{q}{a number: the order of diversity.}

\item{...}{Unused.}

\item{estimator}{an estimator of asymptotic diversity.}

\item{level}{the level of interpolation or extrapolation.
It may be a sample size (an integer) or a sample coverage
(a number between 0 and 1).
If not \code{NULL}, the asymptotic \code{estimator} is ignored.}

\item{probability_estimator}{a string containing one of the possible estimators
of the probability distribution (see \link{probabilities}).
Used only for extrapolation.}

\item{unveiling}{a string containing one of the possible unveiling methods
to estimate the probabilities of the unobserved species (see \link{probabilities}).
Used only for extrapolation.}

\item{richness_estimator}{an estimator of richness to evaluate the total number of species,
see \link{div_richness}. used for interpolation and extrapolation.}

\item{jack_alpha}{the risk level, 5\% by default, used to optimize the jackknife order.}

\item{jack_max}{the highest jackknife order allowed. Default is 10.}

\item{coverage_estimator}{an estimator of sample coverage used by \link{coverage}.}

\item{q_threshold}{the value of \code{q} above which diversity is computed
directly with the naive estimator \eqn{(\sum{p_s^q}^{\frac{1}{(1-q)}}},
without computing entropy.
When \code{q} is great, the exponential of entropy goes to \eqn{0^{\frac{1}{(1-q)}}},
causing rounding errors while the naive estimator of diversity is less and
less biased.}

\item{sample_coverage}{the sample coverage of \code{x} calculated elsewhere.
Used to calculate the gamma diversity of meta-communities, see details.}

\item{as_numeric}{if \code{TRUE}, a number or a numeric vector is returned rather than a tibble.}

\item{check_arguments}{if \code{TRUE}, the function arguments are verified.
Should be set to \code{FALSE} to save time when the arguments have been checked elsewhere.}

\item{gamma}{if \code{TRUE}, \eqn{\gamma} diversity, i.e. diversity of the metacommunity, is computed.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the site names, the estimators used and the estimated diversity.
}
\description{
Estimate the diversity sensu stricto, i.e. the \insertCite{Hill1973;textual}{divent}
number of species from abundance or probability data.
}
\details{
Several estimators are available to deal with incomplete sampling.

Bias correction requires the number of individuals.

Estimation techniques are from \insertCite{Chao2003;textual}{divent},
\insertCite{Grassberger1988;textual}{divent},\insertCite{Holste1998;textual}{divent},
\insertCite{Bonachela2008;textual}{divent}, \insertCite{Marcon2014a;textual}{divent}
which is actually the max value of "ChaoShen" and "Grassberger",
\insertCite{Zhang2014a;textual}{divent}, \insertCite{Chao2014c;textual}{divent},
\insertCite{Chao2015;textual}{divent} and \insertCite{Marcon2015a;textual}{divent}.

The \code{ChaoJost} estimator \insertCite{Chao2013,Chao2015;textual}{divent} contains
an unbiased part concerning observed species, equal to that of
\insertCite{Zhang2014a;textual}{divent}, and a (biased) estimator of the remaining
bias based on the estimation of the species-accumulation curve.
It is very efficient but slow if the number of individuals is more than a few hundreds.

The unveiled estimators rely on \insertCite{Chao2014c;textual}{divent},
completed by \insertCite{Marcon2015a;textual}{divent}.
The actual probabilities of observed species are estimated and completed by
a geometric distribution of the probabilities of unobserved species.
The number of unobserved species is estimated by the Chao1 estimator (\code{UnveilC}),
following \insertCite{Chao2014c;textual}{divent}, or by the iChao1 (\code{UnveiliC})
or the jackknife (\code{UnveilJ}).
The \code{UnveilJ} estimator often has a lower bias but a greater variance
\insertCite{Marcon2015a}{divent}.
It is a good first choice thanks to the versatility of the jackknife
estimator of richness.

Estimators by \insertCite{Bonachela2008;textual}{divent} and
\insertCite{Holste1998;textual}{divent} are rarely used.

To estimate \eqn{\gamma} diversity, the size of a metacommunity (see
\link{metacommunity}) is unknown so it has to be set according to a rule which does
not ensure that its abundances are integer values.
Then, classical bias-correction methods do not apply.
Providing the \code{sample_coverage} argument allows applying the \code{ChaoShen} and
\code{Grassberger} estimators to estimate quite well the entropy.

Diversity can be estimated at a specified level of interpolation or
extrapolation, either a chosen sample size or sample coverage
\insertCite{Chao2014}{divent}, rather than its asymptotic value.
See \link{accum_hill} for details.
