# Summary

`divent` is a package for R dedicated to the measurement of biodiversity.
It provides functions to estimate alpha, beta and gamma diversity of communities, including phylogenetic and functional diversity.

It is a reboot of the [entropart](https://ericmarcon.github.io/entropart/) package to make it easier to use and computationally more efficient.

Main features.

# Statement of need

The definitions and the estimation of diversity in general and specifically biodiversity \> historique

Unified approach based on the theory of information [@Shannon1948] and Hill numbers [@Hill1973].

Extension to phylogenetic and functional diversity: different scientific goals / different data.

DMD.

# State of the field

The entropart R package [@Marcon2014c] was first published in 2015 and augmented following the literature and the research programs of the authors.
It is widely used (around 40 citations every year according to Google Scholar) but suffers from its incremental development and some obsolete choices such as the organisation of the data, camel-case names of objects, and the insufficient consistence between the behavior of different functions.
These issues justified a complete refactoring.

The other major R package with the same purposes is iNEXT [@Hsieh2014] and its update iNEXT.3D [@Chao2021a].

divent vs iNEXT:

-   entropy
-   jackknife
-   ultrametric trees
-   functional distance cutoff.
-   lower-level and more atomic functions.
-   DMD.
-   no temporal beta yet.
