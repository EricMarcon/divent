# divent 0.1-10

- First Version.

## Features

- Data formats.
- Sample coverage.
- Species distributions, metacommunity.
- Richness.
- Shannon's, Simpson's and Tsallis's entropies.
- Hill numbers.
- Diversity accumulation.
- Diversity profiles.

## TODO
- `gamma` diversity OK in ent_tsallis. Copy to other entropies and diversities.
- Check the consistency of entropy at a level with non-integer abundances
- `div_profile` requires integer abundances for its confidence envelope but `gamma` argument is ignored.
